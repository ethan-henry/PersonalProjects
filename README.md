This is a Place to put all the projects that I work on simply for the fun of it :)

minesweperSolver: Solves the minesweeper for google
minesweeperSolverClassic: Solves minesweeper using a more classic look
findMouse: Just continuously prints the value of where the mouse is, making it easy to set up screen captures
OpenCVTest: Just playing with Haar Cascade scanning on face cam
