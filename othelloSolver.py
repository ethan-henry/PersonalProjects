# Idea: Run through Othello random bots, training the model on that data.
#       Keep track of all previous moves, reinforce if they win, punish if they did not?
#       keras rl

# Need to find a way to hook up the kerasrl to my own game so it can just continually play itself

# TODO:
#   Figure out how to use reinforcement learning
#   Figure out how to integrate rl into the code, or at least how to automate the training
#   kerasrl? play with some examples
#   Write Othello as a python environment

# Should I try Reactive Synthesis instead?  Seems interesting, but I would need to figure out a way to represent the game board as a BDD
